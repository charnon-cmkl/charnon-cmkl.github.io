I am currently working as a researcher in academia with a keen interest in all aspects of software engineering. My expertise lies in information security, personal data protection, and identity and access management. Additionally, I am active in communities that utilize formal methods, including formal
specification, formal verification, and static program analysis.

I am also deeply passionate about emerging technologies such as blockchain, Bitcoin, decentralized and self-sovereign identity, consensus mechanisms, and other forms of decentralized technology. Furthermore, I am actively expanding my knowledge and skill set in natural language processing (NLP)
and artificial intelligence (AI). 

Driven by a desire to foster an excellent learning environment in Thailand, I find immense joy in teaching and witnessing the blissful, shining eyes of my friends, juniors, and students when they gain a clear understanding of complex concepts. Currently, I serve as the Assistant Director of IT and an Instructor at CMKL University. I strongly believe that success in my academic journey will equip me with the intellectual foundation to inspire and educate the next generation of youth in Thailand.
