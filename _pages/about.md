I am a dedicated academic researcher with a strong passion for <strong style="color: var(--global-theme-color);">software engineering</strong> and emerging technologies. My professional journey is anchored in a commitment to advancing the frontiers of <strong style="color: var(--global-theme-color);">information security and privacy</strong>, <em style="color: var(--global-theme-color);">personal data protection</em>, and <em style="color: var(--global-theme-color);">identity and access management</em>. These areas form the core of my expertise, and I continuously strive to explore how they intersect with the evolving landscape of digital systems and user-centric applications.

My academic work is closely tied to the application of <strong style="color: var(--global-theme-color);">formal methods</strong>&mdash;including <em style="color: var(--global-theme-color);">formal specification</em>, <em style="color: var(--global-theme-color);">formal verification</em>, and <em  style="color: var(--global-theme-color);">static program analysis</em>. I am actively involved in communities that promote the rigorous application of these methods to ensure software reliability, correctness, and security. I believe that formal techniques are essential tools for developing trustworthy systems, especially in an era of increasing complexity and dependency on software infrastructure.

Beyond traditional software engineering, I am deeply fascinated by <strong style="color: var(--global-theme-color);">decentralized technologies</strong>, particularly those that challenge conventional paradigms of trust, control, and data ownership. My interests include <em style="color: var(--global-theme-color);">blockchain</em>, <em style="color: var(--global-theme-color);">Bitcoin</em>, <em style="color: var(--global-theme-color);">consensus mechanisms</em>, and <strong style="color: var(--global-theme-color);"> self-sovereign identity</strong> frameworks. I am especially drawn to how these technologies can empower individuals, enhance transparency, and redefine digital identity management on a global scale.

In parallel, I am actively expanding my knowledge and technical proficiency in <strong style="color: var(--global-theme-color);">natural language processing (NLP)</strong> and <strong style="color: var(--global-theme-color);">artificial intelligence (AI)</strong>. These fields open new possibilities for human-computer interaction and the intelligent automation of tasks. I believe that mastering AI technologies will enable me to contribute meaningfully to projects that merge intelligence with ethical design, benefiting society in tangible ways.

Outside of research, I am deeply passionate about education and mentorship. As the <u style="color: var(--global-theme-color);">Assistant Director of IT and an Instructor</u> at <strong style="color: var(--global-theme-color);">CMKL University</strong>, I play a key role in shaping academic programs and guiding students through their learning journeys. Teaching is not just a responsibility for me&mdash;it is a profound source of fulfillment. There is nothing more rewarding than seeing the bright, inspired eyes of students and peers when they grasp a complex concept or realize their potential.

I am committed to creating a positive and dynamic learning environment in Thailand. My long-term vision is to contribute to the countryâ€™s academic and technological development by nurturing a new generation of thinkers, innovators, and responsible digital citizens. I believe that a solid foundation in education&mdash;paired with curiosity, integrity, and collaboration&mdash;can transform lives and drive meaningful progress.
